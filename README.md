> You can solve it from an iPad if u want :3

Sonda was a reverse-engineering challenge from `The Game` CTF at [HackUPC](https://hackupc.com/) 2019

This paper explains how the algorithm works through reverse-engineering and how to use [Z3](https://github.com/Z3Prover/z3) in Python to find the flag without doing any maths by hand

## Try challenge
